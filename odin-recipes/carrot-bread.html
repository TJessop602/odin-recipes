<h1>Carrot Bread</h1>
<h3>A low and round loaf filled with carrot and onion</h3>
<p>This recipe is fairly unfussy as to the exact details,
    feel free to stray somewhat from the exact quantities give.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>2 medium carrots</li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>2 tsp thyme (other herbs can also be added)</li>
    <li>2 tsp yeast</li>
    <li>3 cups flour</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>2 Tb oil (canola works well, olive is fine too)</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups warm water</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Grate the carrots into fine shreads and cut up the onion finely</li>
    <li>Fry the carrot and onion in a pan with a dizzling of oil until the 
        carrot shreads lighten in colour and the onion begin to turn 
        gold. This is typically about 5 to 10 minutes on high heat.
    </li>
    <li>Combine all remaining ingredients and kneed them into a dough</li>
    <li>Leave this dough to stand for around 30 minutes to an hour</li>
    <li>Next, add the carrot and onion to the dough and kneed to combine</li>
    <li>Leave the dough in a warm place to rise</li>
    <li>Once you judge it to have risen enough bake at 200 C for 20 minutes,
        for the first 10 minutes cover the top of the loaf with a sheet 
        of baking paper. This stops the crust from burning while we wait for 
        the dough to bake all the way through. Remove this paper for the last
        10 minutes
    </li>
    <li>Remove bread from oven and allow to cool</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
